# ReactiveAnimation [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Declarative animations using ReactiveCocoa signals. See the [Mac
demo](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveAnimation-MacDemo) for an example
of how the library works.

ReactiveAnimation is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

### Getting Started

To import the ReactiveAnimation framework, add `ReactiveAnimation.xcodeproj` as
a subproject and add the appropriate framework target to your application.

Alternatively, you can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to
build the framework for you.
